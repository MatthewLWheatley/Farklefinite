keep a simialr look to the main game, the right hanbd side bar
show money,
reroll button,
current round,
current level,
dont button,

show current dice (at top),
maybe 3 possible dice(in another box),
cost below each dice,
maybe use the 88 constelations for the tarot cards replacements,
maybe also use the star signs which are just main constelations,

idk if i should make a voucher system
